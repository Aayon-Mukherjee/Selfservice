|Description of Self Analysis | Being my first repo on github, I didn't had any idea or experience in the field. I tried my level best for providing a nice story about my passion but after the guidance of my sir Mr. Varad Gupta, I came to realize that using of spaces and indentation plays a vital role in a project, so that a user can enjoy reading the story and also it makes it look more professional. The mistakes in my previous project will not be repeated again as I came to know all the flaws about it like capitalization of initial letters, using **bold** and *italic* fonts wherever required, providing proper spaces after every line and making the text more readable.

## **Improvements to be made on my previous project till 9th April 2021:**

* Using of Proper Spaces and intents.
* Using of more fonts like **bold** and *italic*.
* Providing proper spaces after every line.
* Making it more readable for the user.
  
## **Improvements made so far:**

* Using of more fonts like **bold** and *italic*.
* Providing proper spaces after every line.
